					<p>JavaScript is the language of the web. If you want to code for the web, you need to know JavaScript inside and out. From humble beginnings, JavaScript has grown to a powerful and complex language with features such as classes, promises, arrow functions, generators, string templates, and many others.</p>
					<p>In this course, you'll learn all of the essential concepts of the JavaScript language. That's right: all of them! Including the most important recent improvements to the language, in JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and JavaScript ES7 (ECMAScript 2016).</p>
